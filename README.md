# Personal-Project
I coded a space invaders game in java where a space ship shoots an array of aliens that are descending down with
the objective to killing each alien before it reaches the ship
I used Object Orientated Programming
The game runs without errors: The ship shoots the aliens as the aliens are descending, I am still to implement the
code for the aliens to leave the screen after being shot
